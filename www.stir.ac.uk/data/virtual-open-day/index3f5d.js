The University of Stirling Campus Central. Everything that's really big on campus happens right here. Let's go have a look.\n\nThis is the centre of life on campus. Campus Central features digitally connected spaces for socialising and study, as well as shops, cafes and a new Student Services Hub. \n\nHere you can meet up with friends for a coffee, grab lunch, work through that group project together, or find a space for some quiet study time. \n\nHere you can find a Co-op supermarket, ideal to grab something to eat, pick up anything you need while you're on campus, and even send and return parcels. You'll find the Student Union shop here too, so don't forget your University of Stirling hoodie.\n\nHere in Campus Central, you'll also find the pharmacy - a convenient way to pick up any medicines or prescriptions you might need between lectures. We also have a dedicated NHS general medical practice and dentist on campus. \n\nCoffee and great food are always student must-haves. You don't need to go into town to grab a bite to eat, because Campus Central has loads to choose from, including vegan options, noodles, burgers and more. My favourite is the wood-fired pizza.\n\nAt Campus Central, you'll find the Study Zone where you can work in individual study pods or collaborative learning spaces within easy reach of the library.\n\nHere you'll also find the Institute of Advanced Studies. A thriving postgraduate community to support you and your studies and research. \n\nThe Student Services Hub is your one-stop shop for student support, so you can make the most of your time at Stirling. It brings lots of university services together to answer your questions and put you in touch with different teams. \nYou can call, email, chat via love chat or visit the hub here. To talk to a hub advisor in person, just book an appointment. No need to wait in queues. You can scan the QR code and a text will follow.\nIn the library there's every resource possible for students. With each floor the size of a football pitch, there's everything from study pods and group study rooms to more spaces upstairs for quieter study.\n\nAt Campus Central you'll also find the Green and Blue Space. This space has all the Students' Union environmental activities, including food, waste, energy and everything in between. You can fill up on your kitchen essentials and resell anything you no longer need.\n\nThe Chaplaincy is open to students of all faiths and none, and offers guidance and support, prayer rooms, or just a quiet place for reflection. \nAnd to wrap up a busy day, why not grab some popcorn and catch the latest blockbuster film at the Macrobert Arts Centre. \n\nThere's so much to do at Campus Central, everything's right on your doorstep. Welcome to your new home."},
