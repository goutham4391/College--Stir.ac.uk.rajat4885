<h2 class="">Studying your degree part-time</h2> 
<div class="c-wysiwyg-content"><p>As a part-time student, you can progress at a pace which suits you – taking either one or two modules at a time and starting in September or January. Most part-time students can achieve their degree in five years, although you can take longer if you wish.</p>
<p>Part-time students will join full-time students in undergraduate classes, with one module of study generally requiring a minimum of three separate one hour sessions each week. You’ll have the option of taking one or two modules per semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as attending classes, students are expected to undertake independent study for each module. On average, students are expected to study three hours for every hour in the classroom researching coursework.</p>
<p>To achieve Honours level, most students will have to study on a full-time basis towards the end of their course. Final year dissertations require full-time study, and many specific Honours modules are only available during the day.</p></div>

<h2 class="">Credit for previous qualifications</h2> 
<div class="c-wysiwyg-content"><p>We award credit upon admission for certain qualifications you’ve gained before coming to Stirling. This could shorten the time it will take you to complete your degree.</p>
<p>The most common credit awarded is for prior degrees, HNDs or professional qualifications. Credit is normally at first year University level (SCQF Level 8). Subject-specific credit can be awarded at any level, although normally at the first two years’ University level (SCQF level 8 and 9).</p>
<p>School leavers whose grades and subjects are of a certain level may be able to enter into Year 2 – further information will be on your course page. Students may be able to join in&nbsp;January with partial year credit. If a student has achieved the relevant subjects/grades at A-level or Advanced Higher and are entering at Year 2 they are awarded credit for 6 modules, 120 credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who hold an existing degree are normally given credit to the equivalent of one year’s study if the degree programme permits.</p></div>
